# Competitive Programming

Welcome to the Competitive Programming repository!  
This repository contains a collection of solutions, templates, and notes for various competitive programming problems and topics.

## Contents

- **Algorithms**: Implementations of common algorithms used in contests (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.).
- **Data Structures**: Code for frequently used data structures (segment tree, Fenwick tree, union-find, etc.).
- **Problem Solutions**: Solutions to problems from various online judges (Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, etc.).
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use code templates for quick setup during contests.
- **Notes & Resources**: Helpful notes, tricks, and links to external resources.

## Directory Structure (example)

```
/algorithms/     # Algorithmic code (sorts, searches, etc.)
/data_structures/ # Trees, stacks, queues, etc.
/problems/        # Problem solutions, usually grouped by platform
/templates/       # Quick-use code snippets for contests
/notes/           # Markdown notes, tips, and explanations
```

## How to Use

- Browse the folders for code and explanations.
- Copy-paste templates during contests to save time.
- Read notes for quick revision or learning new concepts.
- Practice by attempting the problems and comparing your solutions.
